# Syntax Guide

This documentation utilized the [Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) syntax.

## Proofs

A proof directive can be included using the `proof:proof` pattern. Unlike the other directives provided through this extension, a proof directive does not include any parameters nor does it require any arguments. A proof directive can easily be referenced through [targets](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html#targets-and-cross-referencing).


**Example**

````{proof:proof}
We'll omit the full proof.

But we will prove sufficiency of the asserted conditions.

To this end, let $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and let $S$ be a linear subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.

Let $\hat y$ be a vector in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $\hat y \in S$ and $y - \hat y \perp S$.

Let $z$ be any other point in $S$ and use the fact that $S$ is a linear subspace to deduce

```{math}
\| y - z \|^2
= \| (y - \hat y) + (\hat y - z) \|^2
= \| y - \hat y \|^2  + \| \hat y - z  \|^2
```

Hence $\| y - z \| \geq \| y - \hat y \|$, which completes the proof.

## Theorems

A theorem directive can be included using the `proof:theorem` pattern. The directive is enumerated by default and can take in an optional title argument. The following options are also supported:

	Value of the theorem’s class attribute which can be used to add custom CSS or JavaScript.

	Turns off theorem auto numbering.

	```{math}
	\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max}
	\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmin}{arg\,min}
	```

**Example**

````{proof:theorem} Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem
:label: my-theorem

Given $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and linear subspace $S \subset \mathbb R^n$,
there exists a unique solution to the minimization problem

```{math}
\hat y := \argmin_{z \in S} \|y - z\|
```

The minimizer $\hat y$ is the unique vector in $\mathbb R^n$ that satisfies

* $\hat y \in S$

* $y - \hat y \perp S$


The vector $\hat y$ is called the **orthogonal projection** of $y$ onto $S$.
